        A bear market is a condition in which securities prices fall 20 percent or more from 
        recent highs amid widespread pessimism and negative investor sentiment. 
        Typically, bear markets are associated with declines in an overall market or index like the S&P 500,
        but individual securities or commodities can be considered to be in a bear market 
        if they experience a decline of 20 percent or more over a sustained period of time - typically two months or more.
        The U.S. major market indexes fell into bear market territory on December 24th, 2018. 
        The last bear market in the U.S. occurred between 2007 and 2009 during 
        The Financial Crisis and lasted for roughly 17 months. The S&P 500 lost 50 percent of its value during that time.

<p class="un">A bear market is a general decline in the stock market over a period of time. 
    It is a transition from high investor optimism to widespread investor fear and pessimism. 
    According to The Vanguard Group, "While there's no agreed-upon definition of a bear market, 
    one generally accepted measure is a price decline of 20% or more over at least a two-month period.
    A smaller decline of 10 to 20% is considered a correction. Once a market enters correction or bear market territory, 
    it isn't considered to have exited that territory until a new high is reached.
    An analysis of Morningstar, Inc. stock market data from 1926 to 2014 found that a typical bear market 
    "lasted 1.3 years with an average cumulative loss of −41%", while annualized declines for bear markets range from −19.7% to −47%.</p>
