<h1>Bull Markets</h1>
<div class="box1">
    <p class="un">
        A bull market is the condition of a financial market of a group of securities in which 
        prices are rising or are expected to rise. The term "bull market" is most often used to 
        refer to the stock market but can be applied to anything that is traded, such as bonds,
        real estate, currencies and commodities. Because prices of securities rise and fall essentially 
        continuously during trading, the term "bull market" is typically reserved for extended 
        periods in which a large portion of security prices are rising. Bull markets tend to last 
        for months or even years.

            India's Bombay Stock Exchange Index, BSE SENSEX, had a major bull market trend for about 
            five years from April 2003 to January 2008 as it increased from 2,900 points to 21,000 points, 
            more than a 600% return in 5 years.Notable bull markets marked the 1925–1929, 
            1953–1957 and the 1993–1997 periods when the U.S. and many other stock markets rose; 
            while the first period ended abruptly with the start of the Great Depression, 
            the end of the later time periods were mostly periods of soft landing, which became large bear markets.
